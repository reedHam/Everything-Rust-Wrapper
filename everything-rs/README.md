# Everything-rs 
This crate provides a safe wrapper around the `everything-sys-bindgen` crate.  
`everything-sys-bindgen` is a rust binding to the [Everything SDK](https://www.voidtools.com/support/everything/sdk/) that allow IPC communication to the everything service.  

The Everything service indexes files on windows and provides a expressive query syntax to search for files.  
See the [Everything SDK documentation](https://www.voidtools.com/support/everything/sdk/) for more information.  

See the crate.io documentation for examples.
